# Water heating curve calculation

Use the Python programming language to create your own and original program for 
calculating the heating of the material in the tank and drawing diagrams with relevant results.

The material in the tank is heated with constant temperature steam, which passes through a heat 
exchanger / heater in the form of a coil tube. 
Two cases are considered: 
   - (a) uninsulated container and
   - (b) perfectly insulated container.

The heat transfer problem for the case analyzed here can be described by the differential equation:

Calculate:
- time required for the material to heat up to the final temperature (in hours),
- total amount of heat consumed,
- and draw diagrams:
- changes in temperature over time,
- changes in heat consumption per unit of time for both cases.
